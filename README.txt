To run this `lec17.py` Streamlit page, you need to:

1. Open the terminal 
	(e.g. Anaconda Terminal, Windows Terminal, command line, bash, etc.),
2. Change your directory to the streamlit folder 
	(e.g. "cd C:\Users\owies\OneDrive - UW\UW\412-522\lectures\streamlit")
3. Run:
	streamlit run lec17/lec17.py

	or

	python -m streamlit run lec17/lec17.py


This is necessary as there are relative paths within the code that will break if your home folder is not the same as the unzipped streamlit folder from canvas.
